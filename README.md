# Auto Splitting Language

Add support in VS Code for LiveSplit's Auto Splitting Language (ASL). ASL Scripts ran with LiveSplit to create Auto Splitters, which have several abilities to automate LiveSplit. ASL allows you to easily specify memory locations and pointers to read data from games and make LiveSplit actions from that data. 

## Features

1. Adds syntax highlighting for the Auto Splitting Language
2. Uses VS Code's C# syntax highlighting for Actions code
3. Adds snippets for valid actions
