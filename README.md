# Auto Splitting Language
Adds Visual Studio Code support for LiveSplit's Auto Splitting Language (ASL). ASL scripts are connected to LiveSplit to create Auto Splitters, which have several abilities to automate LiveSplit. ASL allows users to specify memory locations and pointers to read data from processes. The data is then used to execute certain LiveSplit actions.

## Features
1. Adds appropriate syntax highlighting for the Auto Splitting Language
2. Uses Visual Studio Code's C# syntax highlighting for the actions' code
3. Adds helpful snippets for valid actions and objects
